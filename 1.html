target="_blank" title="my love mac miller">I wasn’t listening through stuff
or doing anything in regard to it.</a> It was about
three months later when I got a call from the family asking me to finish the
album.<br> I remember, before that call came in, being on a flight and listening
to music with my phone on airplane mode. It could only play certain things in
the library,<br> and at some point the working tracks for a couple of the songs
came up: <strong><u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3SEvBYhullC-aaEmbEQflg" target="blank">
  “Good News”</u> and <u>“Once a Day.”</a></u></strong> It flattened me.

<p>To his credit, he never put any claims on me. I think he wasn’t sure if this
  confessional, singing, non-beat-driven stuff that he’d been working on was good
  or not.</p>
<img src="brion.jpg" width="45%">
  <p style="margin-top:40px;"> And I don’t know if he came to me
  seeking approval, or just some help with some sounds or something, but I can
  tell you he got a lot of approval very quickly. I just fell in love with him,
  honestly.</p><p> Especially after we’d spent some real, private time
  making music. He started to play these things that were really insightful
  and individualistic but still felt influenced by his love of hip-hop and
  R&B and dance music.</p> It’s super sad to talk about, but I just felt like,
  “Oh, well, here’s a big part of your future. You can do this. There are a lot
  of people who spend all their time trying to do that and aren’t as good.”
